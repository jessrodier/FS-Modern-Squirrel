Description: A clean, but content-rich, modern theme for Freshservice portals.
Notes: A changelog will be kept when there are updates, indicating which specific files were updated. 


###### INTRODUCTION
------------

**These files are not meant to run as is, but should be copied/pasted into the Customize Portal section of your Freshservice site** 

This repository contains all .txt files with the exception of this README.md file. Each file corresponds with the "Customize Portal" section it should be pasted into.

**Please note that this theme is responsive to an extent. Most of the site will work well on any screen size, but some pages may have issues. I am aware and will continue working towards making it 100% responsive over time, but feel free to report anything you see and I will fix them in that order!**
