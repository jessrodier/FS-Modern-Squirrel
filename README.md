Version 1.0.0
Description: A clean, but content-rich, modern theme for Freshservice portals.
Notes: A changelog will be kept when there are updates, indicating which specific files were updated. 


**PLEASE DO NOT FORK THE 'wilson-master' BRANCH. THIS BRANCH IS FOR A SPECIFIC SUPPORT PORTAL, AND WILL NOT APPLY TO YOUR BUSINESS. THERE ARE NO DIFFERENT FEATURES OR ANYTHING THAT WILL BENEFIT YOU...**


**ALL FORKS MUST BE MADE FROM THE master BRANCH ONLY**


**The wilson-master branch is used to maintain customizations for Wilson's Support Portal specifically, and is not to be used for any other portal. If you would like to use this theme, please work off of the master branch.**

###### INTRODUCTION
------------

**These files are not meant to run as is, but should be copied/pasted into the Customize Portal section of your Freshservice site** 

This repository contains all .txt files with the exception of this README.md file. Each file corresponds with the "Customize Portal" section it should be pasted into.

**Please note that this theme is responsive to an extent. Most of the site will work well on any screen size, but some pages may have issues. I am aware and will continue working towards making it 100% responsive over time, but feel free to report anything you see and I will fix them in that order!**
